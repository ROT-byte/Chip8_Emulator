# Chip8_Emulator
This project involves the development of a CHIP-8 emulator written in C using SDL2, with the aim of emulating the functionality of the classic CHIP-8 interpreter. The emulator simulates the CHIP-8 hardware, including its 4KB memory, 16 8-bit general-purpose registers, special timers for delay and sound, and a basic 64x32-pixel display. The emulator is capable of loading and running CHIP-8 programs, implementing the full set of CHIP-8 instructions, such as those for graphical output, arithmetic, and control flow, as well as the sound and delay timers. The purpose of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of low-level programming and retro computing by recreating the behavior of the original CHIP-8 system while also incorporating modern development tools like SDL2 and Emscripten for web compatibility.
